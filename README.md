Flag uploading script

add username and password to the top to login to your account

put raw png and jpg images in the "input" folder

after running the script, they will be converted to sized, moved to the "output" 
folder, and uploaded as a flag

raw images are then moved to the "unconverted" folder, so the input folder remains 
empty for the next use
